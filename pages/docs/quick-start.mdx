# Quick Start

## Automatic Setup
Getting started is as easy as running the automatic setup script.
```bash
npm init appstrap
````
This will create an appstrap config folder at the root of your project with a preconfigured barebones config file.
This is the recommended way to get started.

---

## Manual Setup
If you prefer to set things up yourself
```bash
npm install @appstrap/core
```

### Creating a config file

By default, appstrap looks for config file in `{projectRoot}/.appstrap/config.js`. This can be overidden in the
configuration options to point to a different path within your project.
Here is an example of the simplest config file needed to get started.
```jsx
module.exports = {
	routes: [
		{ path: '/', get: (req, res) => {res.send('Hello world!')} }
	]
}
```

For more information on the config file read on [here](/docs/configuration)

### Add script to package.json
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "appstrap": "@appstrap/core/go"
  }
}
```
---
## Running Appstrap
### Standalone
After your config file is created you can launch your server via `npm run appstrap`.  This will start a server on
port 3000.  To override the port modify the port assignment in your npm run script like: `"appstrap": "@appstrap/core
--port 5500"`

### Using Appstrap as middleware
Appstrap can be used directly as connect/express middeware via `app.use()`. Here is an example of how to implement this using
`webpack-dev-server`.

```javascript
// webpack.config.js

const Appstrap = require('@appstrap/core')
const AppstrapWebInteractor = require('@appstrap/interactor-web')

module.exports = {
  //... other webpack config
  devServer: {
    before: (app) => {
      const strap = new Appstrap()
      strap.use(AppstrapWebInteractor())
      app.use(strap)
    }
    //... other devserver options
  }
}
```
